The party departs towards[N]
the encampment on the border[N]
between Corbenic and Heichalot.[AN]
Bringing with themselves[N]
Cethern's younger brother Miach,[AN]
they rout an abandoned fortress of[N]
bandits harrassing a young girl.[AN]
With an additional notch on[N]
their belts,[.....] the group continues[N]
from Caer Golud to Caer Wydyr.[A][X]

## P1C3WMIntro2
Caer Wydyr covers the majority[N]
of Corbenic's border with the[N]
Principality of Heichalot.[AN]
Originally a neighbour to Caer[N]
Vedwyd before its rebellion,[.....] Caer[AN]
Wydyr normally shares friendship[N]
with both Myanchao and Heichalot.[AN]
The chills of coming winter and[N]
war chip away at this peace,[AN]
leaving an unsteady and looming[N]
dread over the Corbenic camp...[A][X]

I didn't know how else to show[N]
her intention,[.....] so I--[A]

Hold right there![......] This proves nothing![......][N]
You could have killed her yourself![AN]
Unless you have a reason for me not[N]
to call for any of the soldiers...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Please sir,[.....] you have to believe me![......][N]
Both her and Sir MacCumail wanted to--[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sir MacCumail?[......][MoveMidLeft] Hold once again![......][N]
You bear the resemblance of him...[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Both my brother and I are grandchildren[N]
of Sir MacCumail.[AN]
I would have no intentions of ever[N]
harming a Crownflier.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I can't say I completely believe your[N]
story,[......][CloseEyes] but there's no harm believing it.[AN][OpenEyes]
My name is C[0xFA] Raoi.[......] I'm the[N]
strategist for Caer Wydyr's nobility.[AN]
You must be wishing to lay down your[N]
life to fight Heichalot,[.....] yes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes.[......] It's only us two though.[......][N]
We had more with us,[.....] but...[A]

Are you the guy in charge?[A]

Excuse my brother's behaviour,[.....] Sir

Hmmm.[.......] Excuse me for one second.[......][N]
Touch nothing in here.[A][ClearFace][......]
[Right]
I told you to stay outside,[.....] Miach![......][N]
What are you thinking?![A]
[FarRight]
You're not gonna convince him alone![......][N]
I'm helping you,[.....] I swear![A]
[Right]
It's good to have a second face,[.....][N]
but you need to watch your tone.[AN]
We're talking with nobility.[A]

Terribly sorry to leave.[......] I've decided[N]
what you two may help with.[AN]
Hanlin,[.....] may you come inside?[A]

This is Hanlin,[.....] one of our healers.[AN]
Hanlin,[.....] these are Cethern and Miach.[A]

Greetings.[A]
[FarLeft]
We're lucky to have her here,[.....][N]
but we're still lacking support.[AN][MoveFarLeft]
I'd like you to take the younger[N]
boy and train him as a medic.[AN]
Even some basic understanding would[N]
go a long way to helping the injured.[AN]
As for Cethern...[AN]
Would you happen to know[N]
where Picodobra is located?[A]
[MidRight]
I'm afraid not.[......][N]
We come from Caer Rigor.[A]
[MidLeft]
Picodobra is a border village due[N]
eastward from this camp.[AN]
We've had a lack of forces to[N]
send there.[......][ToggleSmile] Until now.[AN]
I'd like you and whoever is with[N]
you to help fortify the town.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Should you need it,[.....] I can offer[N]
funds for you to resupply with.[AN]
It would be a small amount,[.....] but[N]
enough to pay for weaponry.[A]
[Left]
.[....].[....].[......][MoveLeft][LoadOverworldFaces][N]
C[0xFA] Raoi.[......] Please find another.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Hanlin,[.....] what are you--?[A]
[Left]
My skills are in riding,[......] not[N]
staying put in some army camp.[A] 
[FarLeft]
Absolutely not![AN]
I refuse to let one of our few[N]
healers endanger herself as such![A]
[Left]
Our lack of medics is because[N]
of a lack of willing hands.[......] Getting[AN]
a different medic to train Miach[N]
would be as effective as my stay.[A]
[FarLeft][CloseEyes]
Hmmm...[.......] Very well.[N]
You may accompany Cethern.[AN]
Take this gold and escort[N]
Miach to the north tent.[A]
[MidRight]
You are too generous,[.....] Sir C[0xFA] Raoi.[......][N]
We will do Corbenic proud.[A][X]

Are you sure I can't come with you?[......][N]
Being with the healers sounds boring...[A]

It's the safest choice.[......] Just think[N]
of it as weapon training.[AN]
I'm sure I'll be back to check[N]
in on you eventually.[A]

My name is Hanlin.[.....] I'm one of the few[N]

Something about the healers?[A]
[Right]
That old guy's forcing me to stay with[N]
them.[......][CloseEyes] My brother's forcing me too...[A][OpenEyes][N][N]
[FarRight]
And you must be heading off to fight.[......][N][LoadOverworldFaces]
I implore you to take me as well.[AN]
My skills are being wasted[N]
living in a nurses' tent.[A]
[MidLeft]
Would it be okay with Sir C[0xFA] Raoi?[......][N]
He told me of a lack of medics...[A]
[FarRight]
This boy is joining them.[......] It's a[N]
lack of hands,[.....] not skill.[AN]
Please.[......] I am trained with both[N]
staves and horseback.[A]
[MidLeft]
We could use that...[AN][MoveMidLeft]
As long as Sir C[0xFA] Raoi[N]
allows it,[......] absolutely.[A]
[Right]
What?![......] Even the medic gets to join[N]
you?![......] That's not fair at all![A]

Let me escort the boy.[AN][ToggleSmile]
